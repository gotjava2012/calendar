### Spring

# We need to satisfy Spring Boot's DataSource auto-configuration.
# Auto-config can be disabled with some effort, but it goes against the grain of Spring's opinionated start-up flow.
# Simply provide here the database connection information - since we're local, we'll use H2

## Datasource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:local-appointment-scheduler-db
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.hikari.auto-commit=false

## JPA
# Lets us see all of the SQL being generated by JPA
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Instead of managing DDL automatically via JPA, we'll use a more explicit approach using Flyway instead
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none

# Tell JPA to use an H2 dialect instead of what we'll use in production -> Postgres
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
