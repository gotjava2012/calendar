     * What a weird class. Here's the objective : create appointments at a random interval.
     *
     * Two things : 1) We don't _always_ want to enable this for obvious reasons. Limit it to a specific Spring profile and allow it to be included, if desired.
     * 2) We're opting to do this in the application itself to keep everything centralized. This can just as well be a bash script that runs outside the app.
     *
     * Due to #2, we want to lean on Spring where possible. This means trying to reuse existing concepts - namely @Scheduled. Spring doesn't include a
     *
     * @ Scheduled(fixedDelay = randomEveryTime) for obvious reasons, so this will have to work slightly differently. Schedule this method to run every second
     * and give the method a chance at doing something useful. Think : every second has a n% chance at creating a new appointment, where n is configurable via
     * Spring.
     *
     * Do not use this in a real world setting :)
