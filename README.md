This is a demo project using Spring Boot to implement RESTful web services by creating an appointment scheduler application.

# Technologies
- Java 11
- JUnit 5
- Spring Boot 2.1
- Postgres 10
- Docker 18.09
- Docker Compose 3.7

# Quickstart
## How to Build

#### Run the following from your command line
```bash
mvn clean install
docker-compose up --detach
```

#### Verify docker-compose starts - you should see the following
```bash
Starting appointment-scheduler_db_1 ... done
Recreating appointment-scheduler_api_1 ... done
```

#### Check docker for the running container information
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                    NAMES
xxxxxxxxxxxx        /appointment-scheduler:1.0   "java -jar /usr/shar…"            15 seconds ago      Up 13 seconds             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   appointment-scheduler_api_1
xxxxxxxxxxxx         postgres:10                          "docker-entrypoint.s…"   6 minutes ago       Up 14 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   appointment-scheduler_db_1
```

Ensure that the application is alive and happy by calling the health API.

## Appointment Autogenerate
You will also notice that, as the application runs, it will automatically create new appointments at random intervals. 
This is to help exercise the endpoints without bothering with curl / Postman / ARC / etc. while demonstrating the elegance of Spring profile composition. 

If you wish to _not_ auto-create appointments, simply remove the `random-scheduler` Spring profile from `docker-compose.yml`.

For more detail around this feature, please see `com.parsley.calendar.services.RandomScheduler.java`.
